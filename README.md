## Introduction
This compiler is built to facilitate the translation of high-level programming language(C++) code into machine code or intermediate code. The goal is to provide an efficient and reliable tool for developers to compile their code and produce executable programs.

## Features
- `Lexical Analysis:` Tokenization of source code.
- `Syntax Analysis:` Parsing and validation of the code structure.
- `Semantic Analysis:` Ensuring the correctness of the code in terms of its meaning.
- `Intermediate Code Generation:` Creating an intermediate representation of the source code.
- `Code Optimization:` Enhancing the efficiency of the generated code.
- `Code Generation:` Producing target machine code or an equivalent output.

## Codes
- [Infix To Postfix](Codes/Infix_To_Postfix.cpp)
- [File_Handling](Codes/File_Handling.cpp)
- [Tokenization](Codes/Tokenization.cpp)

## Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jixiee/CompilerConstruction.git

## Architecture
To be updated soon.
