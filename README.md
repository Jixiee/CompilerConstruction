## Introduction
Codes for CC lab record

## Features (of a compiler)
- `Lexical Analysis:` Tokenization of source code.
- `Syntax Analysis:` Parsing and validation of the code structure.
- `Semantic Analysis:` Ensuring the correctness of the code in terms of its meaning.
- `Intermediate Code Generation:` Creating an intermediate representation of the source code.
- `Code Optimization:` Enhancing the efficiency of the generated code.
- `Code Generation:` Producing target machine code or an equivalent output.
